The Infosec Community Definitive Guide to Jupyter Notebooks to empower other researchers around the world to share, collaborate and help others through interactive environments. This is a community-driven project and contains documentation about the installation of a Jupyter Notebook server and interesting use cases for security research.

## Goals:

* Expedite the time it takes to start working with Jupyter Notebooks
* Share use cases in different areas of InfoSec where notebooks can help
* Aggregate and centralize information about Jupyter Notebooks for security researchers
